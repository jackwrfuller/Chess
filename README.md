# Jack's Chess Game
A first attempt at creating chess application.

## Game rules implemented:
- [ ] Move legality checking:
    - [x] Pawns
    - [x] En passant
    - [x] Kings (without checking for checks)
    - [ ] Kings (with checking for check)
    - [x] Rooks
    - [x] Bishops
    - [x] Queens
    - [x] Knights
    - [ ] Castling
- [ ] Pawn promotion
- [ ] Checking
- [ ] Checkmate
- [ ] Stalemate
- [ ] 50 move rule
- [ ] Draw by repetition
 
## Code to be reviewed

This is for sections of code that I'm not happy with, and think needs reviewing:

- [ ] En passant functionality. It seems overly complicated and involves too much repetition.
    I reckon it could be optimised and refactored significantly.
